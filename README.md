# Split Youtube Chapters

An example of the timestamps file format:

    0:00 - Intro hello how to approach this video
    1:50 - MODULE 0 START (TensorFlow deep learning fundamentals)
    1:53 - [Keynote] 1. What is deep learning?
    6:31 - [Keynote] 2. Why use deep learning?
    16:10 - [Keynote] 3. What are neural networks?
    26:33 - [Keynote] 4. What is deep learning actually used for?
    35:10 - [Keynote] 5. What is and why use TensorFlow?
    43:05 - [Keynote] 6. What is a tensor?
    46:40 - [Keynote] 7. What we're going to cover
    51:12 - [Keynote] 8. How to approach this course
    56:45 - 9. Creating our first tensors with TensorFlow
    1:15:32 - 10. Creating tensors with tf Variable
    1:22:40 - 11. Creating random tensors
    1:32:20 - 12. Shuffling the order of tensors
    1:42:00 - 13. Creating tensors from NumPy arrays

It will also work when chapter names and timestamps are separated with whitespaces instead of hyphens (-).
